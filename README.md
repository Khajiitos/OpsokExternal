Update notes:

1.3, 09/01/2021:

- Added No flash
- Aimbot is toggled off by default (it can be toggled on using the bottom side mouse button) because it sucks LOL
- Code improvements
- Updated offsets

1.2, 12/12/2020:

- Glow alpha (thickness) can be changed in the config
- Aimbot (aimlock) FOV can be changed in the config
- Added automatic recoil control to aimbot
- Added a very basic visibility check for aimbot, which is usually a bit slow (0.5-1s delay) (disabled by default)
- If the cheat is launched while CS:GO isn't running, instead of closing it, it will wait for you to open CS:GO without having to close the cheat
- The console window of the cheat will have an aqua colored text
- Added support to execute commands in the console while the cheat is working (multithreading), it will be used later to add useful commands or to change settings without having to recompile
- General code improvements
- Updated offsets

1.1, 29/11/2020:

- Added Aimbot (lacks a visibility check and is sometimes inaccurate especially when the height difference between you and the target is high) and is togglable (by default: bottom side mouse button)
- Triggerbot now requires for a key to be held to work (by default: upper side mouse button)
- Updated offsets
