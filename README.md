Update notes:

1.1, 29/11/2020:

- Added Aimbot (lacks a visibility check and is sometimes inaccurate especially when the height difference between you and the target is high)
  and is togglable (by default: bottom side mouse button)
- Triggerbot now requires for a key to be held to work (by default: upper side mouse button)
- Updated offsets
